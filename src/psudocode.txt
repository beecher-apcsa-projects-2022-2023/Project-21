Main: This class takes two integers bigger than 100,000 as user inputs, and it contains the main() method.
In the main() method, a Scanner object is created to receive user inputs. For each input, the program checks if the input is
greater than 100,000. If either input is less than or equal to 100,000, the program displays an error message and terminates.
If both inputs are valid, the program creates a Server object with the two inputs, and then it displays the
result by calling the toString() method of the Server object.

Server: This class represents the server for computing the GCD of two input numbers and formatting the result.
It contains a constructor, insertCommas(), formatNumber(), and toString() methods. In the constructor, the two input numbers
are initialized. The insertCommas() method takes a string as input and inserts commas as thousand separators. The
formatNumber() method takes a BigInteger as input, converts it to a string, and then calls the insertCommas() method to
format the string with commas. The toString() method computes the GCD of the two input numbers using the gcd() method of
the BigInteger class, formats the GCD and the input numbers using the formatNumber() method, and then returns a string
representation of the result in the format of "GCD of num1 and num2 is: GCD".
